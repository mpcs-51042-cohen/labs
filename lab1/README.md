# Lab 1

For this first lab, let's just make sure you can run Python on your computer
and you can turn in your lab to Canvas.

## Instructions

1. Introduce yourself to at least one classmate near you.
2. Get to know them a bit: maybe ask for the name of their hometown, 
   their favorite flavor of ice cream, what kind of phone they have, etc.
3. Keep track of each classmate's data in a data structure that you choose.
4. Use code to iterate over each person's data and print a nice summary to the screen.
5. Even if you don't finish completely, upload your Python file to Canvas under Lab #1. Full credit will be given for any halfway-decent attempt!

**IMPORTANT**: Try to limit yourself to using only the Python techniques we've covered today, even if you know of more advanced uses of the Python language.
