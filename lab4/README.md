# Lab 4

## Today's Goal

Get more practice at "functional thinking".

Start with strmod.py, then try satisfy.py.  See each file for specific instructions.

## Turning In Your Lab / Working With Others

Working with others is encouraged. Only one person in the group needs to turn in your combined work.

If you are turning in the work performed by the group, simply list their names below and include this file in your submission:

* [name]
* [name]

## Lab Setup

**There are special restrictions in place for this lab to encourage a functional mindset.**

You may **NOT** (unless otherwise stated) use:

- `while` or `match` statements
- `for` or `if` *statements* (unless used in comprehensions, which are allowed)
- the `len` function
- the `in` operator (`x in y`)
- sequence methods like `list.append`, etc.
- repetition via `sequence * int`
- global variables
- the ternary operator syntax `X if Y else Z`
- the `match` statement
- `max(), min(), sum(), all(), any()`
- `import` statements other than `functools` and `operator`

You **MAY** (unless otherwise stated) use:

- comprehensions of any type
- make your own helper functions (but they too must obey these restrictions)
- `functools.reduce`
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce
    - https://realpython.com/python-reduce-function/
- `functools.partial`
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial
    - https://www.learnpython.org/en/Partial_functions
- All other builtin functions like `map`, `filter`, `range`, `tuple`, `bool`, `list` are allowed. (`list(...)` can be useful to convert the result of a map/filter into a `list`.)
- Unpacking syntax like `a, b = (1, 2)`.

If in doubt about a function or language feature, try to solve the problem with what we've covered
in class first before reaching for something else.
