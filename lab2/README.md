# Lab 2

This lab is designed to make sure you're comfortable with the more common
data types.

## Instructions

Take a look at the .py files included in this folder.  Instructions for each
can be found at the bottom of this file.

Pick one that you'd like to work on, and see how far you can get with it.

If you finish the exercise, or just get tired of working on it, pick another.

NOTE: KEEP TRACK OF YOUR QUESTIONS

If you get stuck, or get curious and can think of a question,
KEEP TRACK OF IT by writing it down somewhere so we can share them in class
(or so you can remember to pursue it later).

## Turning In Your Work

We will do this part together in class:

1. Zip up your "week2" folder into a single .zip file.
2. Upload the .zip file to Canvas for the Lab 2 assignment.
