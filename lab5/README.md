# Lab 5

## Today's Goal

Become familiar with objects, classes, and instances in Python.

A set of failing unit tests has been provided.  Based on the unit tests,
write the simplest possible code that will pass the tests.

## Turning In Your Lab / Working With Others

Working with others is encouraged! Only one person in the group needs to turn in your combined work.

If you are turning in the work performed by the group, simply list their names below and include this file in your submission:

* [name]
* [name]

## Lab Setup

Be sure to sync the project dependencies first:

```bash
lab5$ uv sync
```

Running the Tests:

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
lab5$ uv run pytest test_library.py -v

# Run and stop at first failure (useful for debugging)
lab5$ uv run pytest test_library.py -x
```
